## Description

Anime Explorer is a one-page web application that leverages the free [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe) to help users explore anime data in a rich, interactive format. The app displays results as uniformly sized cards (4 per row, 20 per page) that include key details such as title, score, episode count, and a short synopsis. When you click **Leggi di più**, a fullscreen modal opens with the anime’s full details—including an image, genres, and a synopsis—and a clear **Chiudi** (Close) button for returning to the list.

This release also includes robust sorting (by score, title, episodes), search functionality, a dynamic chart of the top 10 anime by score (powered by Chart.js), and a theme toggle (Day/Night).

## Features

- **Uniform Grid Layout:** Results are shown as cards in a 4-column grid with pagination (20 results per page).
- **Detailed Modal:** On clicking **Leggi di più**, a fullscreen modal displays additional information and an image, with a **Chiudi** button to close.

- **Dynamic Analytics:** A Chart.js bar chart shows the Top 10 anime by score.
